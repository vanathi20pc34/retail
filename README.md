This is a retail chatbot used by customers to check whether the items are there in stock.
I have used HTML, CSS and JS for frontend.
I have used MySQL for databse and Flask framework for backend.
When the customer opens the chatbot it automatically displays a message and if customer asks whether the stock is available it answers yes or no.
